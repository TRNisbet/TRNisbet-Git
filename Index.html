    <p style="width:50%">
        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse,
        and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the
        watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my
        soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the
        rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that
        it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street,
        and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time tozz get to sea as soon
        as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws
        himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If
        they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly 
        the same feelings towards the ocean with me. </p>
